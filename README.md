 Install the following Python libraries using pip:
nltk
spaCy
textblob
• Load the above libraries in a Python script or Jupyter notebook.
• Write a Python script to tokenize a simple sentence using NLTK.
• Load the English language model in spaCy and Perform POS tagging on the following
sentence.
sentence = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
• Write a Python function to clean text by converting it to lowercase and removing punctuation.
This week’s lab assignment is all about implementing your first language model.
You are supposed to download a huge body of text at least (10,000 words). You can download the
text from Wikipedia.
• You now must create a model that computes the probabilities of the next word based on
unigrams and bigrams.
• Assignment: Given a starting word, you now must predict the whole sentence of length 15
using the ideas of both unigrams and bigrams.
